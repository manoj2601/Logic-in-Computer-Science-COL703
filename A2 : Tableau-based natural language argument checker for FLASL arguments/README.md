## How to Run:

Use any of one ways among the following:
* paste the input to `arg-inp.flasl` and run `make`. The output will be stored in `arg-inp.out` file.
* use terminal command: 
```
sml proptableau.sml <flasl_inp_file.flasl>
```
 
The final results will be stored in `<flasl_inp_file.out>` file in the same directory.
